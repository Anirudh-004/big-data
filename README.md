## Setup:
* Install APACHE SPARK:  https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html

* Install PYSPARK

## Description:

### Data Pre-Processing: 

* The dataset taken is from kaggle website related FIFA 2019 which has many attributes contributing to each football player.

* Pre-processing involves removing columns which are not needed for analysis, removing unwanted symbols, removing null values and employing feature scaling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analysis and Visualization includes the data and its respective plots that will help the football manager to take intrinsic decisions.

* Finding the attributes or columns with highest correlation and plotting those attributes.

* Determining the change in market value and overall rate of players with age.

* Using the K-means clustering machine learning algorithm we built a cluster based model that results in highest correlated columns that are computed with respect to player's position.
