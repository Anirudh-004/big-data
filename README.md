Setup: 

1. First Install APACHE SPARK:  https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html.

2. Install PYSPARK.

Explanation: 

Data Pre-Processing:

1. The Dataset considered is of football players with many attribute columns from FIFA 2019. 

2. The Preprocessing involves removing columns which are not needed for analysis, removing unwanted symbols, removing null values and feature scaling


Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analysis and Visualization includes the data and plots which can help a football manager to take decisions. They are as follows:

1. Finding the attributes or columns with highest correlation and plotting those attributes.

2. Determining the change in market value and overall rating of players with age.

3. Using K-means clustering machine learning algorithm we built a cluster based on highest correlated columns that are computed with respect to player's position.
